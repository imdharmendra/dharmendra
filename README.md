I am a postgraduate student pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) with a strong foundation in software development and a focus on full-stack web technologies, particularly the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I am passionate about building efficient, scalable applications and continuously enhancing my technical skills through real-world projects. In addition to my interest in software development, I am also keen on exploring the intersection of technology and the banking/finance sector. This GitHub profile serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing my academic and personal development projects, with a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code and contributing to innovative solutions.
